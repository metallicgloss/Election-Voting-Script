Hello,

Just wished to provide some assistance in getting this application running in the event you need it.

We make use of multiple PIP packages, to install that them, please execute the following in this directory:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This project makes use of a remote MySQL database, for your ease of setup, we've kept it hosted, running and available for the next few months until this is marked.
The details for MySQL are included in connectionString.py; if you wished to login via Heidi or MySQL workbench to review our tables or dummy data.
An SQL dump has been provided if you wished to setup this application using an alernative host.

Default login details:

Username: Test
Password: Test

(Please note, this user has voted for 10-15 positions, so will only have 4 or so left due to position 20 not having 4 candidates).

I hope this helps!
